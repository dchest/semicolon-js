Semicolon.js
============

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/dchest/semicolon-js.png)](https://travis-ci.org/dchest/semicolon-js)

You no longer need to put `;` before your JavaScript code! Use Semicolon.js!!!


Installation
------------

Clone this repository:

	git clone https://github.com/dchest/semicolon.js

or using [Bower](http://bower.io):

	bower install semicolon


Usage
-----

When you want to concatenate scripts, just add Semicolon.js for every file!

Example:

	cat file1.js semicolon.js file2.js semicolon.js > out.js



T-Shirt
--------

[Buy a beautiful t-shirt with Semicolon.js logo!](http://www.cafepress.com/semicolonjs.1224973466)
Because [every](https://twitter.com/search?q=gulpjs%20t-shirt&src=typd) JavaScript project must have a t-shirt!
All proceeds will be donated to people who bought other stupid t-shirts.


FAQ
---

### I don't get it.

Just stop putting a semicolon at the beginning of your code. Please.

Semicolons to terminate statements are good:

	var x = 1;
	return x;

A semicolon before the code to protect from people who can't concatenate files
is a useless piece of junk:

	;var x = 1;
	return x;

### Whaaaat?

Apparently some people believed that to fix improper concatenation of
JavaScript files (in some cases they can't be safely concatenated);
they needed to prepend semicolon to their code instead of properly
concatenating files. Then other JavaScript developers read
their code and [continued this unfortunate tradition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cargo_cult_programming).

If you'll ever see this code:

	;function()...

tell its author to use Semicolon.js instead of putting semicolon there.


### How is it different from [vapor.js](https://github.com/madrobby/vapor.js) or earlier [semicolon.js](https://github.com/madrobby/semicolon.js)?

These frameworks are jokes; my Semicolon.js is a real deal and comes with ideology (see above).
